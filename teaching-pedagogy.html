      <p> <b>All Round Development:</b> <br>
        Modern Ways is committed to the holistic development of children through the wide range of challenging
        co-curricular and extracurricular activities which is an important part of total education. <br>
        Students are exposed to a wide range of curricular activities such as Music, Dramatics, Arts, Community
        Services, and excursions. Our aim is to offer ample opportunities so that the students enjoy and feel confident
        of their abilities, needless to say, they play an important role in developing social skills, values, a spirit
        of co-operation and above all regional and national consciousness.

      <h2>Homework:</h2>
      <p>We value highly the partnership we have with parents and recognize the importance of the support they give to
        their child with home learning. Any work we give will be to reinforce or extend what is learned at school.
        Homework is important because it is at the intersection between home and school. It serves as a window through
        which you can observe your children's education and express positive attitudes towards your children and their
        education. As children grow older, homework and the amount of time engaged in homework increases in importance.
        For teachers and administrators, homework is a cost-effective way to provide additional instruction in practice.
      </p>
      <p>Let's examine the six constructive purposes for homework in the context of your child's educational experience.
        The first two are the most important and obvious. Through (1) practice and (2) participation in learning tasks,
        homework can improve your child's achievement. Thus, it would be expected that if homework were completed
        accurately, not only would your child's general knowledge and grades improve but your child would also increase
        mastery of basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, spelling, and mathematics.</p>
      <p>Homework can provide other benefits. Your child's ability to bring an assignment home, gather and organize
        necessary materials to complete the assignment, return the assignment and receive a grade, strengthens his or
        her sense of responsibility. Time management skills are learned. There is also improved (3) development of
        personal skills such as time management gained by completing homework. Further, when homework proceeds smoothly
        it can become (4) a positive aspect of your relationship with your child.</p>
      <p>Finally, although we often do not consider that homework serves a school administrative role, it offers schools
        an opportunity to let parents know what their children are learning. Thus, homework can play a public relations
        role by (5) keeping parents informed about class activities and policies. Homework can also fulfill (6) an
        administrative role in helping schools achieve their overall mission of improving student's achievement.
        Homework is a bridge that joins schools and parents. From the school's perspective, there is the opportunity to
        monitor students' independent progress. For parents, there is the potential to gain a greater appreciation of
        education and to express positive attitudes towards their children's achievement.</p>

      <h2>CCA:</h2>
      <p>The students are trained at a very young age to inculcate a sense of responsibility, loyalty, team spirit, and
        healthy competition to develop a positive attitude in them. They are encouraged to participate in CCA. The
        school provides a range of extracurricular activities to enhance other than academic aspects of a student's
        personality. The range of activities varies from class to outdoor activities. Events like debate competition,
        calligraphy competition, poem recitation competition, rangoli making competition, reading competition, poster
        making competition, sports events, theatre trips, visit to historical places, educational trips, entertainment
        trips, etc. are regularly conducted in the school. These activities and trips help to enrich and enhance the
        student's educational experiences. The most important aim of conducting such activities is to bring students and
        teachers near to each other so that it helps the institution to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the
        students.</p>
