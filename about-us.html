      <p>The Modern Way Educational Society (Regd.) had started a school in the name of Modern Ways Model School, Sector
        29-C, Chandigarh. The school aims to give high-value education to meet the current challenges of high standards
        and all-round development of the child in education, sports, yoga, culture, and extra-curricular activities from
        the lower kindergarten to twelfth standard level in CBSE syllabus. It provides a loving & caring environment in
        the learning activities. It also makes the child interact with other children through co-operative learning.
        Looking to the better future of a child, we have introduced the Pre-School programme.

      <h2>Aim:</h2>
      <p> <ul>
        <li>To develop unity among the students from different religions, languages, and cultures.</li>
        <li>To provide a suitable environment to encourage studies. </li>
        <li>To eliminate inferiority complex among students.</li>
        <li>To develop good communication skills among students.</li>
        <li>To build an innovative mindset among students.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>The School aims to provide high-quality facilities and a healthy environment for the all-round development of
          the child.</p>
      </p>

      <h2>Nurturing Values:</h2>
      <p>Education has been undergoing a sea of change over the decades. In the past, it was considered a tool for
        getting a job. Today, it is not just a means for achieving a suitable job. Every parent wants his/her child to
        grow into a perfect human being from a shy or noisy child after completing education. It is an indisputable fact
        that education gets high status in the society irrespective of their financial position. The corollary is also
        true. However financially sound you are, you will never get due recognition if you don't have a proper
        education.
        Education is a sort of oxygen for prestigious social living. So the school started its mission almost 50 years
        back. Now people behind the mission can proudly wear the recognition from CBSE, New Delhi as a proof of
        faultless effort and unbridled dedication they have put up.
      </p>
      <h2>Imparting the values of knowledge:</h2>
      <p>Very high-quality teaching is assured in ModernWays Model Senior Secondary School right from the kindergarten
        itself. Teachers invariably use multimedia facilities like Smart Learn Classrooms and Audio Visual Laboratory to
        convey better ideas about the subjects to the students. Science subjects are taught with the aid of simple
        models and pictures. To make children speak English fluently and confidently, the school uses learning tools.
        Students are provided with an opportunity to construct models and create charts from what they learn.
        As IT is the buzzword of today's world, the school tries its level best to keep up with the times by initiating
        IT training. Computer education starts in this school from the first standard onwards. The school has an
        internet facility and teachers guide students through World Wide Web. Video Conferencing, Multimedia lab, slide
        projector, and 16 mm movie projector are also used to enhance the understanding of the students about the
        particular subjects.
        Classes are conducted by well-qualified and efficient faculty. The classrooms are spacious and specially
        designed furniture is provided in each classroom. The strength of a class is stipulated to just 40 students.
        This helps teachers to concentrate more on each student. Students are admitted after an entrance test.
        Seats are reserved for economically weaker sections of the society as per the Government.
        In keeping with the philosophy of exploring the unknown, the physical environment at our school is a highly
        effective teaching tool and much planning goes into its creation. Adequate facilities are provided on the school
        campus.
