          <h2>Campus:</h2>
          <p>The school is geared up with an excellent infrastructure that is essential in creating a suitable
            environment for the process of learning. The spacious and serene 2 Acres campus enables the student
            community to feel the inspiring touch of mother nature that leaves them with a sound and sharp mind for
            their studies.</p>
          <p>Along the corridor, are grades I to XII. There is a buzz of excitement and activity in the air. Following
            the latest trends, the thematic-inter-disciplinary approach has been adopted. The curriculum encourages
            children to explore their interests, as they move gradually from the familiar to the unknown scope in social
            skills of adaptability and teamwork.</p>
          <p>The curriculum addresses the uniqueness of each child and provides exposure beyond the academic role play,
            dance, music, field trips, sports and a range of hobby interests add new dimensions to the growth of the
            child.</p>
          <p>Our faculty are experienced in the fields of early childhood education and child development. In addition
            to this, all members of staff participate in continuous in-service training by experienced trainers and take
            part in curriculum design and implementation, assessment strategies, and classroom management as well.</p>
          <p>Our school has classrooms that have direct access to the corridor. They are well lighted and well
            ventilated. The library, science lab, language lab, smart class, art room all are designed with great care
            according to the needs of the students. The large playing field and playground area are well used by all our
            children.</p>
          <p>The school building and ground are under NO SMOKING ZONE. The CCTVs installation in the school compound has
            made it more secured and well supervised. These CCTVs not only keep an eye on the activities in the
            classrooms but also on the ground.</p>

          <h2>Classrooms:</h2>
          <p>Classrooms are large and have windows that flood rooms with light and fresh air. All areas incorporate open
            space that allows children to freely move around and select how they want to work. Walls are decorated with
            children's work, given a strong sense of ownership and pride; they like what they do here. They think it's
            important as it's on 'display'. The play area contains a wide range of child-friendly equipments plus an
            extensive section of natural fauna and flora.</p>

          <h2>Faculty:</h2>
          <p>Keeping in mind the criteria that the success of educational reforms depends on the qualitative imparting
            of education, creative, competent, and professionally qualified teachers are recruited. The teachers,
            working as a closely-knit community have prompted excellent work culture of the highest professional
            standards.</p>
          <p>The staff members are provided with a supportive and congenial work atmosphere and the orientation
            programmes under the aegis of the staff development programme, have always prompted the right motivation
            competency and above all, helped in updating the staff with the latest methodologies of classroom teaching
            thereby enabling them to give their professional best.</p>

          <h2>Library:</h2>
          <p>The Library is well stocked with a plethora of books from various disciplines. Children are fascinated by
            the world of books and are encouraged to read, go through pictures, narrate and discuss themes and facts. A
            library hour is scheduled for each grade and it is ensured that children make the most of this hour.
            Videotapes, a picture library, CDs, and audiotapes form the rest of the collection in the library. Children
            are encouraged to make use of the library for all references. Being an open self-help library, children are
            free to pick up and browse through any book.</p>

          <h2>Sports:</h2>
          <p>We do not believe that for the growth and development of a personality only mental development is
            necessary. Physical health is also an important aspect of the full-grown individual to encourage and create
            awareness among a new generation for health and utilization of their recreation time our sports department
            plays an important role. We encourage our students to use their skills and extra energy in sports like
            volleyball, Badminton, Cricket, Kho-Kho, and athletics according to their skills and stamina and well we
            have indoor games to develop their minds like chess, Scrabble and Carom Board.</p>

          <h2>Smart Learn Class Rooms:</h2>
          <p>As we want to keep pace with the new trends of education i.e. making learning fun rather than a burden we
            believe in a naturalistic viewpoint that the mind can be developed only in a free environment and for that,
            the senses should be conditioned. For this, our Smart Learn Class Room provides the child the environment
            where he learns with the senses whose impact remains everlasting and develops an understanding of concepts
            easy and interesting.</p>
